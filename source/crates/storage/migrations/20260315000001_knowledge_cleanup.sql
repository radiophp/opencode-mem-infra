-- Knowledge cleanup migration: strip UUIDs from titles, merge duplicates,
-- fix null/invalid project names.

-- 1. Strip UUID suffixes from knowledge titles.
-- Pattern: optional whitespace + hex UUID (8-4-4+ with optional trailing segments).
UPDATE global_knowledge
SET title = TRIM(REGEXP_REPLACE(title, '\s*[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4,}(-[0-9a-f]*)*\s*', ' ', 'gi')),
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE title ~* '[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4,}';

-- 2. Merge duplicate knowledge entries (same lowercased title after UUID stripping).
-- Keep the entry with highest usage_count (ties broken by earliest created_at).
-- Sum usage_counts, merge source_observations arrays, take highest confidence.
--
-- VULNERABILITY (Breaker Agent): JSON Scalar Exception
-- If ANY row in `global_knowledge` contains a JSON `null` ('null'::jsonb), scalar (e.g., '123'::jsonb),
-- or object ('{}'::jsonb) in `source_observations`, `jsonb_array_elements` will throw:
-- "ERROR: cannot extract elements from a scalar/object".
-- Since there is no CHECK constraint on `source_observations` enforcing it to be a JSON array,
-- a rogue scalar completely bricks this migration, locking out the entire app from starting!
