- If this REFINES or ADDS TO an existing observation above → action: "update", target_number: <number in brackets of the observation to update>
- If this adds ZERO new information beyond what already exists → action: "skip"

OBSERVATION TYPES — choose the MOST SPECIFIC type:

{types_prompt}
CLASSIFICATION DECISION TREE (follow in order):
1. Was a bug found AND fixed? → "bugfix" (must have root cause + fix)
2. Was an architectural or design choice made between alternatives? → "decision"
3. Was code restructured without changing behavior? → "refactor"
4. Was a new capability/endpoint/feature completed? → "feature"
5. Was configuration, deployment, or infrastructure changed? → "change"
6. Was something unexpected/surprising discovered about how code/API works? → "gotcha"
7. Did the user express a preference for how things should be done? → "preference"
8. Was genuinely new knowledge learned about how an existing system works? → "discovery"

"discovery" is the LAST resort, not the default. It means "I learned how something works" — not "something happened."

ANTI-DEFAULT RULE: If you choose type="discovery", you MUST prove it is not one of the 7 types above. Your type_reason field must explicitly state why bugfix/change/decision/refactor/feature/gotcha/preference do NOT apply. If you cannot prove this, pick the more specific type.

SKIP INSTRUCTION — return action: "skip" for ANY of these:
- Status updates: "published X", "deployed Y", "completed task Z", "merged PR"
- Progress reports: "finished step 3 of 5", "working on feature X"
- Transactional confirmations: "file saved", "test passed", "build succeeded"
- Routine file reads/writes with no surprising content
- Metadata: "database has N records", "N files changed"
- Generic knowledge available in any documentation (e.g. "Rust uses ownership")
These have ZERO information value for future sessions. Do not create observations for them.
{existing_context}
NOISE LEVEL GUIDE (5 levels — be precise, "medium" is NOT a safe default):
- "critical": Production outage, data loss, security vulnerability, core architectural decision that affects the entire system. Would cause system failure if ignored.
- "high": Bugfix with root cause analysis that saves hours of debugging, significant gotcha/pitfall, architectural decision with clear tradeoffs, user preference that changes workflow.
- "medium": Non-obvious implementation detail, minor gotcha worth noting, configuration that has side effects. ONLY if it would concretely help a future agent — not "might be useful someday."
- "low": Environment-specific workaround, minor configuration tweak, observation that is correct but unlikely to be needed again.
- "negligible": Routine work, generic knowledge, status updates, file edits, build output, duplicates. DISCARD.

ANTI-DEFAULT RULE: If you choose noise_level="medium", you MUST explain in noise_reason what SPECIFIC future scenario this observation would help with. "Might be useful" or "good to know" are NOT valid reasons. If you cannot name a concrete scenario, use "low" or "negligible."
