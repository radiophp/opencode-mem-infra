| Structured Summaries | ✅ 100% | response_format: json_object, 9 typed fields (request, investigated, completed, next_steps, files_read, files_modified, decisions, discoveries) |

### NOT Implemented

| # | Feature | Priority | Effort |
|---|---------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Cursor/IDE hooks** — IDE integration | LOW | Medium |

### Experimental (Ready)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Infinite Memory** | ✅ Ready | PostgreSQL + pgvector backend for long-term AGI memory. Session isolation, hierarchical summaries (5min→hour→day), content truncation. Enabled via INFINITE_MEMORY_URL. **Raw events are NEVER deleted** — drill-down API allows zooming from any summary back to original events. |
| **Dynamic Memory** | ✅ Ready | Solves "static summaries" problem. **Deep Zoom:** 4 HTTP endpoints (`/api/infinite/expand_summary/:id`, `/time_range`, `/drill_hour/:id`, `/drill_minute/:id`) for drilling down from summaries to raw events. **Structured Metadata:** `SummaryEntities` (files, functions, libraries, errors, decisions) extracted via `response_format: json_object`. Enables fact-based search even when text summary is vague. |
| **Semantic Search** | ✅ Ready | fastembed-rs (BGE-M3, 1024d, 100+ languages). PostgreSQL: pgvector. Hybrid search: FTS BM25 (50%) + vector similarity (50%). HTTP endpoint: `/semantic-search?q=...`. |

## ADR: Context-Aware Compression (CREATE/UPDATE/SKIP)

**Status: ✅ Fully Implemented**

### Problem
LLM always creates NEW observations even when near-identical ones exist. The `existing_titles` dedup hint in the prompt only lists titles — the LLM lacks enough context to confidently mark duplicates as negligible. Post-facto dedup (cosine similarity merge, background sweep) catches some duplicates but is fundamentally reactive: duplicates are created, then cleaned.

### Constraints
- API calls are free (zero cost concern)
- ~100 observations in DB, growing slowly
- FTS + GIN index exists on `search_vec` tsvector column
- `response_format: json_object` is required for all LLM calls
- Raw events preserved in Infinite Memory (observations are derived views)

### Decision: Enrich compression prompt with candidate observations, let LLM decide CREATE/UPDATE/SKIP

**One code path, three outcomes.** Before LLM compression, retrieve top 5 candidate observations via FTS on raw input text. Feed their full content to the LLM alongside the new tool interaction. LLM returns a discriminated result:

- **CREATE**: Genuinely new knowledge → full observation (current behavior)
- **UPDATE(target_id)**: Refines existing observation → full replacement of target's content fields
- **SKIP**: Zero new information → log and discard

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Merge-or-create gate (separate pre-search → conditional prompt branching)** — Rejected. Two code paths, two prompt templates, patch parsing, false positive recovery. Over-engineered for a context starvation problem.

2. **Aggressive post-facto dedup only (lower thresholds, more frequent sweeps)** — Rejected. Treats symptoms. Duplicates still created, wasting LLM calls and storage churn.

3. **Pre-embed raw input for semantic search** — Rejected. Raw tool output has low similarity to compressed observations (different vocabulary, length, structure). FTS keyword matching is sufficient for candidate retrieval.

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Candidate retrieval** (in `ObservationService`, before LLM call)
- Extract keywords from raw input via `plainto_tsquery`
- Query `observations` via existing `search_vec` GIN index, limit 5
- Also include 2-3 most recent observations from same session (most likely merge targets)

**Phase 2: Prompt modification** (`crates/llm/src/observation.rs`)
- Replace `existing_titles` with full candidate observations (id + title + narrative + facts)
- Add DECISION section: CREATE / UPDATE(id) / SKIP
- Response schema becomes discriminated union with `action` field

**Phase 3: Response handling** (`crates/service/src/observation_service/`)
- Parse `action` field from LLM response
- CREATE → existing `persist_and_notify` path
- UPDATE → validate target_id exists and was in candidate set → full field replacement → regenerate embedding
- SKIP → log at debug, return early

**Phase 4: Simplify dedup layers**
- Post-facto cosine dedup becomes safety net only (keep threshold at 0.85)
- Background sweep remains as defense-in-depth (30 min interval)
- Echo detection (0.80) stays unchanged (different purpose: injection recursion prevention)

### Watch Out For
- **Candidate retrieval quality**: if FTS misses the relevant observation, LLM creates a duplicate. Mitigate by also including recent same-session observations.
- **LLM hallucinating target_id**: validate returned ID exists AND was in candidate set. If not → treat as CREATE.
- **Token growth**: 5 candidates × ~500 tokens = ~2500 extra tokens per call. Negligible for current models.

## Tech Debt & Known Issues

- Gate MCP review tooling intermittently returns 429/502 or "Max retries exceeded", blocking automated code review.
- Test coverage: ~40% of critical paths. Service layer, HTTP handlers, infinite-memory, CLI still have zero tests.
- **CUDA GPU acceleration blocked on Pascal** — ort-sys 2.0.0-rc.11 pre-built CUDA provider includes only SM 7.0+ (Volta+). GTX 1060 (SM 6.1 Pascal) gets `cudaErrorSymbolNotFound` at inference. CUDA EP registers successfully but all inference ops fail. CUDA 12 compat libs cleaned up from home-server. Workaround: CPU-only embeddings with `OPENCODE_MEM_DISABLE_EMBEDDINGS=1` for throttling. To resolve: either build ONNX Runtime from source with `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=61`, or upgrade to Volta+ GPU.

- ~~HTTP→Service layer violation~~ — all 9 handlers migrated to use `QueueService`, `SessionService`, `SearchService`. Zero direct `state.storage.*` calls in handlers.
- ~~dedup_tests.rs monolith (1050 lines)~~ — split into 4 modules: union_dedup_tests, merge_tests, find_similar_tests, embedding_text_tests. 3 misplaced tests relocated.
- ~~StoredEvent.event_type String~~ — changed to `EventType` enum with `FromStr` parser. Unknown types logged as warning and skipped (Zero Fallback).
- ~~No newtypes for prompt_number/discovery_tokens~~ — `PromptNumber(u32)` and `DiscoveryTokens(u32)` newtypes in core, used in Observation, SessionSummary, UserPrompt.
- ~~No typed error enums in leaf crates~~ — `CoreError` (4 variants), `EmbeddingError` (4 variants), `LlmError` (7 variants with `is_transient()`) defined and used in public APIs.
- ~~SQLite timeline query missing noise_level~~ — SQLite backend removed
- ~~PG search/hybrid_search empty-query fallback type mismatch~~ — fallback returned `Vec<Observation>` where `Vec<SearchResult>` was expected. Wrapped with `SearchResult::from_observation`.
- ~~PG knowledge usage_count INT4 vs i64 mismatch~~ — `global_knowledge.usage_count` was `INT4` in PG but decoded as `i64`. ALTERed column to `BIGINT`.
- ~~Memory injection recursion~~ — observe hook re-processed `<memory-*>` blocks injected by IDE plugin, creating duplicate observations that got re-injected in a loop. Added `filter_injected_memory()` at all entry points: HTTP observe/observe_batch (before queue), session observation endpoints, CLI hook observe, save_memory, plus service-layer defense-in-depth.
- ~~Dedup threshold env var without bounds validation~~ — `OPENCODE_MEM_DEDUP_THRESHOLD` and `OPENCODE_MEM_INJECTION_DEDUP_THRESHOLD` now clamped to [0.0, 1.0] on parse. Values outside cosine similarity range no longer silently disable detection.

- ~~SQLite PRAGMA synchronous mismatch~~ — SQLite backend removed
- ~~SearchService bypasses HybridSearch abstraction~~ — fixed, correctly delegates to internal struct
- ~~Queue processor UUID entropy & format violation~~ — fixed, uses strict UUIDv5 namespace over SHA-256 string input
- ~~ObservationType SPOT violation~~ — fixed, LLM prompt string dynamically generated from enum variants
- ~~Queueprocessor bottleneck~~ — fixed, background tasks spawned as fire-and-forget to avoid head-of-line blocking
- ~~Settings state ignored~~ — fixed, API updates propagated to `LlmClient::update_config` and `std::env::set_var`
- ~~Privacy leak in title~~ — fixed, applied `filter_private_content` inside `save_memory` title param
- ~~Privacy filter omission in queues~~ — fixed, `observe` and `observe_batch` handlers apply filter before database insertion
- ~~Infinite Memory LLM request bypasses retry logic~~ — already fixed (uses LlmClient::chat_completion with backoff)
- ~~Knowledge extraction skips updated observations~~ — already fixed (extracts from `save_result` regardless of is_new flag)
- ~~Dedup sweep overwrite bug~~ — already fixed (compute_merge resolves by noise_level importance)
- ~~Infinite memory time hierarchy violation~~ — already fixed (pipeline buckets strictly by 300s window)
- ~~Double-quoted observation_type/noise_level corruption (733/904 records)~~ — fixed by DB migration (`TRIM(BOTH '"')`) + `FromStr` defense-in-depth normalization (`trim().trim_matches('"')`) in `ObservationType`, `NoiseLevel`, `Concept`
- ~~Infinite Memory call_id UNIQUE constraint breaks pipeline on 2nd event~~ — fixed by using deterministic UUID (observation ID) as call_id instead of `String::new()`
- ~~Queue UUID hash omits tool_input — silent data loss on same-second calls~~ — fixed by including `tool_input` in UUIDv5 hash
- ~~save_and_notify title collision retry exhaustion silently drops data~~ — fixed: returns `Err` (goes to DLQ) instead of `Ok` when all 5 retries fail
- ~~Knowledge extraction noise level inversion (skipped Critical/High instead of Low/Negligible)~~ — fixed: now skips `Low | Negligible`, extracts knowledge from high-value observations
- ~~get_events_by_time_range broken fallback query (ILIKE instead of time range)~~ — fixed: correct `WHERE ts >= $1 AND ts <= $2` with proper parameter binding
- ~~get_session_by_content_id non-deterministic on duplicate content_session_id~~ — fixed: added `ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 1`
- ~~Vector search string serialization overhead (10KB string per query)~~ — fixed: uses `pgvector::Vector` binary protocol in semantic and hybrid search
- ~~FTS split-on-punctuation in tsquery builders~~ — `build_tsquery` and `build_or_tsquery` now split on non-alphanumeric chars instead of filtering, preventing fused tokens like `srcutilsrs`
- ~~Global observations invisible in project-scoped searches~~ — all `WHERE project = $1` queries now include `OR project IS NULL`
- ~~SQL operator precedence fragility~~ — `project = $1 OR project IS NULL` wrapped in parentheses in all queries
- ~~CJK single-char filter killed non-Latin search~~ — removed `chars().count() < 2` filter, added DoS guard (100 term truncate)
- ~~Infinite Memory data loss on LLM compression failure~~ — `store_infinite_memory` now runs concurrently with `compress_and_save` via `tokio::join!`
- ~~SPOT violation in tsquery builders~~ — extracted `tokenize_tsquery` and `build_joined_tsquery` shared helpers
- ~~Circuit breaker never trips on DB connection failures~~ — `StorageError::is_transient()` now covers `PoolClosed`, `WorkerCrashed`, and connection-refused `Database` errors. `is_unavailable()` delegates to `is_transient()`. `ServiceError::is_db_unavailable()` checks `Search(anyhow)` and `System(anyhow)` via string inspection for connection patterns. Service layer `with_cb()` records success/failure on every storage call. HTTP handlers use `From<ServiceError> for ApiError` (not `anyhow` wrapping) so the `Degraded` variant is triggered correctly.
- ~~Circuit breaker bypass in infinite memory MCP handlers~~ — fixed by adding `cb_fast_fail_infinite` guards to all infinite memory MCP tool handlers
- ~~strip_markdown_json fails on LLM preamble~~ — fixed by `find`/`rfind`-based extraction instead of regex, handles arbitrary preamble text before JSON
- ~~parse_limit SPOT violation (hardcoded DEFAULT_QUERY_LIMIT)~~ — fixed by accepting per-tool defaults, each MCP tool specifies its own default limit
- ~~Zero Fallback in parse_pg_observation_type/parse_pg_noise_level~~ — fixed by returning `DataCorruption` errors instead of silently defaulting to fallback values
- ~~ResponseFormat.format_type raw String~~ — fixed by `ResponseFormatType` enum with typed variants
- ~~KnowledgeQuery/SaveKnowledgeRequest knowledge_type raw String~~ — fixed by using `KnowledgeType` enum directly in query/request types
- ~~Raw `as` casts in pipeline.rs~~ — fixed by checked conversions (`TryFrom`, `try_into`)
- ~~Files >300 lines (memory.rs 488, search_service.rs 471, pg_storage/mod.rs 470, observation_service/mod.rs 459)~~ — fixed by module splits into focused submodules
- ~~Infinite Memory spin-loop~~ — `release_events()` and `release_summaries_*()` now set `processing_started_at = NOW()` instead of NULL, providing cooldown via the existing 5-minute visibility timeout
- ~~deduplicate_by_embedding O(N²) blocks async runtime~~ — O(N²) comparison loop moved into `spawn_blocking`
- ~~Unstable pagination in get_observations_paginated~~ — added `id` as secondary `ORDER BY` tie-breaker
- ~~Tombstone save silent discard~~ — `save_observation(&tombstone)` errors now logged at warn level with context
- ~~Cross-project dedup failure (5x duplicate noise-classification observations)~~ — `find_candidate_observations` now searches across all projects instead of current-only, preventing cross-project knowledge duplication
- ~~save_memory metadata poverty (empty facts/concepts/keywords)~~ — background LLM enrichment extracts structured metadata after persist, with re-fetch from DB before knowledge extraction
- ~~Knowledge extraction gate too restrictive (Gotcha-only)~~ — removed observation_type filter, all non-Low/Negligible observations now eligible for LLM-driven knowledge extraction
- ~~MCP knowledge usage_count always zero~~ — increment moved from MCP handlers to KnowledgeService (SPOT), both MCP and HTTP paths now track usage
- ~~Multi-byte truncation OOM in LLM error messages~~ — replaced `response.get(..300).unwrap_or(&response)` with `core::truncate()` char-boundary-safe helper
- ~~Panic in spawned tokio tasks aborts server~~ — removed `.expect()` and `.unwrap()` from queue_processor, queue, serve spawned tasks
- ~~Enrichment clobbers concurrent observation updates~~ — `update_observation_metadata` checks `rows_affected()`, logs and skips on concurrent modification
- ~~save_memory enrichment silently failing (all 53 manual observations had empty metadata)~~ — root cause: `OPENCODE_MEM_API_URL` missing from both systemd service and opencode MCP config, causing LLM calls to go to `api.openai.com` with an Antigravity API key (silent auth failure). Fixed by adding `OPENCODE_MEM_API_URL=https://antigravity.quantumind.ru` to both configs. Added `backfill-metadata` CLI command for re-enrichment.
- ~~MCP binary split-brain (opencode-memory SQLite vs opencode-mem PostgreSQL)~~ — fixed by unifying MCP config to use opencode-mem with explicit DATABASE_URL, INFINITE_MEMORY_URL env vars in opencode.json
- ~~Missing OPENCODE_MEM_API_URL in systemd and MCP config~~ — fixed by adding https://antigravity.quantumind.ru to both configs, enabling LLM enrichment
- ~~Outdated model in systemd (gemini-3-pro-high)~~ — fixed: updated to gemini-3.1-pro-high
- ~~observation_type search filter case-sensitive~~ — fixed: lowercased at service layer in hybrid_ops.rs
- ~~CLI search bypasses SearchService~~ — fixed: uses smart_search() for semantic/hybrid routing
- ~~backfill-metadata single-batch truncation~~ — fixed: proper loop with progress tracking and infinite-loop prevention
- ~~Session summaries never generated (0/2168 sessions)~~ — `get_sessions_without_summaries` joined on `sessions.id` (UUID) but observations store IDE content session IDs (`ses_*`) that never match. Fixed: query now groups observations by `session_id` directly, bypassing the sessions table. `generate_pending_summaries` uses `save_summary` instead of `update_session_status_with_summary`.
- ~~Infinite Memory migration 20260314000000 references `events` instead of `raw_events`~~ — fixed table name in normalize_project_names migration
- ~~Semantic search poor relevance (scores 0.48-0.55)~~ — root cause: IVFFlat index with lists=100 on 959 vectors, probes=1 searched only 1% of vector space. Fixed by replacing with HNSW(m=16, ef_construction=64). Scores improved to 0.55-0.94 with correct semantic ranking.
- ~~Missing `updated_at` column on observations table~~ — added migration 20260315000003
- ~~Knowledge duplicates (4x Telegram MTProto entries)~~ — cleaned up, kept entry with highest usage_count
- ~~5 observations with empty metadata from manual import~~ — backfilled via CLI
- ~~`/api/semantic-search` route inconsistency~~ — added alias alongside existing `/semantic-search`
- ~~Background processor not started in MCP mode~~ — added shared MaintenanceServices + run_maintenance_tick(), both HTTP and MCP use same scheduler
- ~~Admin endpoints CSRF via missing Json extractor~~ — added Json(()) body to destructive admin endpoints
- ~~Admin auth bypass via loopback trust behind reverse proxy~~ — dual-mode: token required if set, loopback-only if unset
- ~~Infinite memory compression poison pill on >200 events~~ — pipeline fetches up to 10K events, chunks at 200 per LLM call
- ~~strip_markdown_json forward scan truncates JSON with embedded backticks~~ — uses rfind for closing fence
- ~~MCP background loop SPOT violation (only ran compression)~~ — extracted shared MaintenanceServices, all 7 tasks run in both modes
- ~~Pipeline dead code (chunking unreachable due to batch limit)~~ — removed per-iteration batch limit, proper chunking for large buckets
- ~~run_full_compression bypassed circuit breaker~~ — routes through CB with should_allow/record_success/failure
- ~~Session summaries unstructured free text~~ — structured via response_format: json_object with 9 typed fields
- ~~JSON corruption in infinite memory compression pipeline~~ — serialized JSON string was truncated by `.chars().take(N)`, breaking closing braces/quotes and poisoning LLM prompts. Fixed by `truncate_json_values()` which truncates text fields *inside* the `serde_json::Value` before serialization, preserving valid JSON structure
- ~~`.chars().take(N).collect()` SPOT violation (5 call sites)~~ — all replaced with `opencode_mem_core::truncate()` which handles char boundaries correctly. Affected: `compression_prompt.rs`, `compression.rs`, `save_memory.rs`, `knowledge.rs`, `observations.rs`, `unified.rs`
